## Why AgriPulse?

Agriculture is data-poor in many communities. AgriPulse offers:

- **Actionable insights** — soil moisture trends, pest alerts, crop rotation advice  
- **Forecast integration** — weather + yield predictions  
- **Marketplace connect** — let farmers see who’s buying or selling  
- **Community alerts / forums** — share tips, report disease, collaborate  

We believe in bridging traditional farming wisdom with modern data tools.

## Features

- Dashboard: crop status, alerts, trending metrics  
- Soil & moisture sensor integration  
- Weather & yield forecast module  
- Marketplace listings & match-making  
- Forums / Q&A board  
- User profiles & farm setup  
- Responsive design (works well on mobile)  
- Role-based access (farmer, agronomist, admin)
